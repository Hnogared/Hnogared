### Quick introductiom ###

Welcome to my profile page, thank you for checking it out and I hope you are having a good day !

I am currently studying at [42 School][42 Github Link], where I learn about low level programming, as well as object oriented programming, and the ground notions of clean code and optimization with the C and CPP languages.

I am also learning scripting notions by experimenting with bash and vimscript in my free time.

Finally, I like to have fun with Python for communicating with APIs or write down quick concepts.
